Composition vs Inheritance - two ways to the same destination: Inheritance
So far we've been using and following the inheritance concept when modeling our classes to represent real-life issues. Inheritance is a great concept, one of the most important foundations of object-oriented programming that models a tight relation between two classes: the base class and the derived class, called a subclass.

The result of this relation is a subclass class that inherits all methods and all properties of the base class, and allows a subclass to extend everything that has been inherited. By extending a base class, you are creating a more specialized class. Moreover, we say that these classes are tightly coupled.

Inheritance models what is called an is a relation.
Examples:

a Laptop is a (specialized form of) Computer;
a Square is a (specialized form of) Figure;
a Hovercraft is a Vehicle.
The primary use of inheritance is to reuse the code. If two classes perform similar tasks, we can create a common base class for them, to which we transfer identical methods and properties. This will facilitate testing and potentially increase application reliability in case of changes. In case of any problems, it will also be easier to find the cause of the error.

As a result, your inheriting classes could form a tree.


tree

Note: the hierarchy grows from top to bottom, like tree roots, not branches. The most general, and the widest, class is always at the top (the superclass) while its descendants are located below (the subclasses).

What could be inherited in this “Vehicles” structure?

All classes derived from Vehicles own properties and methods responsible for informing the user of its mileage, starting and stopping the vehicle, fueling, etc. Once you inherit a “mileage” property from the base class, then it is present in all subclasses.

The same principle should apply to the tank() method responsible for fueling every vehicle object, so the polymorphism, another pillar of the OOP allowing you to call the tank() method on every “vehicle” object, is easily achieved.

The inheritance concept is a powerful one, but you should remember that with great power comes great responsibility. When you are reckless, then with the inheritance (especially multiple inheritances) you can create a huge, complex, and hierarchical structure of classes.

This hierarchy would be hard to understand, debug, and extend. This phenomenon is known as the class explosion problem, and is one of the antipatterns of programming.

"""
Inheritance is not the only way of constructing adaptable objects. You can achieve similar goals by using a concept named composition.

This concept models another kind of relation between objects; it models what is called a has a relation.

Examples:

a Laptop has a network card;
a Hovercraft has a specific engine.
Composition is the process of composing an object using other different objects. The objects used in the composition deliver a set of desired traits (properties and/or methods) so we can say that they act like blocks used to build a more complicated structure.


It can be said that:

inheritance extends a class's capabilities by adding new components and modifying existing ones; in other words, the complete recipe is contained inside the class itself and all its ancestors; the object takes all the class's belongings and makes use of them;
composition projects a class as a container (called a composite) able to store and use other objects (derived from other classes) where each of the objects implements a part of a desired class's behavior. It’s worth mentioning that blocks are loosely coupled with the composite, and those blocks could be exchanged any time, even during program runtime.

"""
Let's try to write some code to see how composition works.

Look at the simple code presented in the editor pane.

The “Car” class is loosely coupled with the “engine” component. It’s a composite object.

The main advantages are:

whenever a change is applied to the engine object, it does not influence the “Car” class object structure;
you can decide what your car should be equipped with.
Our “Car” could be equipped with two different kinds of engine – a gas one or a diesel one. The developer's responsibility is to provide methods for both engine classes, named in the same way (here is thestart() method) to make it work in a polymorphic manner.

class Car:
    def __init__(self, engine):
        self.engine = engine


class GasEngine:
    def __init__(self, horse_power):
        self.hp = horse_power

    def start(self):
        print("Starting {}hp gas engine".format(self.hp))


class DieselEngine:
    def __init__(self, horse_power):
        self.hp = horse_power

    def start(self):
        print("Starting {}hp diesel engine".format(self.hp))


my_car = Car(GasEngine(4))
my_car.engine.start()
my_car.engine = DieselEngine(2)
my_car.engine.start()
