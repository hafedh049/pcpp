(Note that an assignment statement is being used, so evaluation of the right side of the clause takes precedence over the left side.)

At first, an object (a list in this example) is created in the computer's memory. Now the object has its identity;
then the object is populated with other objects. Now our object has a value;
finally a variable, which you should treat as a label or name binding, is created, and this label refers to a distinct place in the computer memory.
